## The Application: AI Research Lab Assistant

An AI assistant for managing ML/AI research papers that:

- **Ingests ArXiv papers** - PDF loading and text extraction
- **Semantic search** - Find papers by meaning, not just keywords
- **Answers questions** - RAG-powered Q&A about research
- **Summarizes papers** - Extract key findings
- **Multi-agent coordination** - Paper Summarizer, Experiment Tracker, Insight Finder
- **Links to MLflow** - Connect papers to experiments

## Platform Services Used

All notebooks integrate with these Thinkube services:

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| LiteLLM | Unified LLM gateway |
| Qdrant | Vector database for RAG |
| Langfuse | Observability and tracing |
| MLflow | Experiment tracking |
| PostgreSQL | Paper metadata storage |
| Valkey | Caching |
| NATS | Multi-agent messaging |

## Prerequisites

- JupyterHub access on Thinkube platform
- `tk-jupyter-agent-dev` image (for notebooks 00, 01, 02, 03)
- `tk-jupyter-fine-tuning` image (for notebook 04)

## Getting Started

1. Open JupyterHub: `https://jupyter.{your-domain}`
2. Select `tk-jupyter-agent-dev` image
3. Navigate to `research-assistant/`
4. Start with `00-platform-validation.ipynb` to verify services
5. Work through notebooks in order (00 → 04)

## Development Approach

These notebooks are built using **documentation-driven development**:

1. Each notebook contains working, tested code
2. Code is validated against actual platform services
3. Outputs and results are real, not mocked
4. Issues encountered are documented
